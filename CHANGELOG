# Changelog

## [0.3.0-r2]
### Bug Fixes
* Fix documentation bug

## [0.3.0-r1]
### Bug Fixes
* After looking at tokio's `File` implementation, the file descriptor should block for
the `Stream` implementation

## [0.3.0]
### Breaking changes
* Type signature of `bind` and `connect` calls' `groups` parameter was changed to be a `Vec<u32>`
which will allow specifying a list of IDs and the group bitmask will be calculated for the user.
* `poll` implementation of for `NlSocket` for `tokio::prelude::Stream` trait will now return
`io::ErrorKind::InvalidData` if the socket file descriptor is not set to non-blocking
before polling. This is intentional as Tokio docs rely on polls being non-blocking and my
implementation requires a read that either returns an `io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock` value or
the desired data.
* There is now an `nlattr` module to group together all of the netlink attribute code.

### Additions
* A function `block` was added to allow reversing `nonblock` function on `NlSocket`.
* `is_blocking` was added and returns a `bool` indicating whether reads will block on this socket.

### Deprecations
* `get_payload_as` was deprecated in favor of `get_payload_with`.

### Removed
None

## Versions prior to 0.3.0 are not included in the CHANGELOG
